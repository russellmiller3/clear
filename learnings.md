## Clear Compiler

### The 1:1 Rule (most important)
- **Every line of compiled output must trace back to one line of Clear.** If you can't point to the Clear line that generated a piece of output, the compiler is doing magic. Magic means future Claude can't debug it from the Clear source. See PHILOSOPHY.md "1:1 mapping" section.
- **CHECKOUT, OAUTH_CONFIG, and USAGE_LIMIT currently violate this rule.** They generate routes, functions, and imports the user never wrote. These need redesigning -- the Clear source should explicitly declare endpoints, not have the compiler invent them.
- **The GAN model fixes this over time.** Build real apps in Clear, hit gaps, fix the compiler. Each app is a discriminator. See ROADMAP.md "Compiler Evolution Roadmap."

### Synonym / Tokenizer Traps
- **Never register a word as a synonym if it's used as a literal in another context.** `background` collided with CSS `background` property. `incoming` would steal the token from `validate incoming:`. Always grep existing synonyms AND existing parser code before adding.
- **The tokenizer strips trailing colons** (line 328 of tokenizer.js). This breaks route params: `/api/todos/:id:` loses both colons. Fix: store `raw` text on tokenized lines and extract paths from raw source in parseEndpoint.
- **`.toLowerCase()` on token values will crash if the value is a number.** Token values from NUMBER tokens are actual JS numbers, not strings. Always guard with `typeof value === 'string'` before calling string methods.
- **`as` has canonical `as_format`, not `as`.** When checking for the `as` keyword in parser code, match `canonical === 'as_format'`, not `canonical === 'as'`. Same pattern: check actual canonical values in synonyms.js, don't guess.
- **`max` has canonical `maximum`, `size` has canonical `length`.** Synonym rewriting changes the canonical before your parser sees it. Always check what the tokenizer actually produces, not what you think it should.

### CRUD Operations in Assignments
- **`look up` and `save...as` must be intercepted inside `parseAssignment`.** These appear on the right side of assignments (`todos = look up all Todos`) but aren't expressions -- they're CRUD operations.
- **CRUD `where` conditions reference column names, not variables.** `where id is incoming's id` -- the bare `id` is a column name. The validator should NOT check these against defined variables.
- **CRUD save with `resultVar` needs both parser and compiler support.** `new_todo = save incoming as Todo` -> CRUD node with `resultVar = 'new_todo'`. The compiler emits `const new_todo = await db.insert(...)`. The validator must add `resultVar` to `localDefined`.

### Endpoint Compilation
- **Endpoints now bind `incoming` automatically.** `const incoming = { ...req.body, ...req.params }` at the top of every endpoint body. This is the one implicit line.

## Clear Compiler Refactoring (2026-04-01)

- **Context object beats per-language function duplication.** A single `compileNode(node, ctx)` with `ctx = { lang, indent, declared, stateVars }` eliminates all duplication.
- **Parser-owned UI metadata eliminates a compiler pass.** Moving computation to parser node builders as `node.ui` property lets the HTML scaffold read metadata directly.
- **Separate validation from codegen for opt-in checking.** `compile()` is pure codegen. `compileProgram()` orchestrates both.
- **Wire new functions alongside old ones, then delete.** Adding new functions without removing old lets you run all tests at each step.

---

## Clear CLI & Language Phases 12-14 (2026-04-01)

- **Clear's `clear/` directory has zero `$lib/` imports -- it's self-contained.** The CLI can `import { compileProgram } from '../index.js'` and it works with plain `node`.
- **`parseExpression` returns `{ node, nextPos }` not `{ expr, pos }`.** Use `result.node` not `result.expr`.
- **Canonical endpoint syntax is `on GET '/path':` not `endpoint GET '/path':`.** Always check `synonyms.js` for the canonical form.
- **Multi-word synonyms must be registered before single-word parsing works.** `deploy to` is a two-word synonym. If you only register `deploy`, parsing breaks.
- **Multi-word synonyms can collide with existing syntax.** `count by` as a synonym matches inside `increase count by 1`. Check the full synonym table AND common syntax patterns before registering new multi-word synonyms.
- **Data shape fields need direct token parsing, not `parseBlock`.** The line `name is text, required` gets misparsed as an ASSIGN if you delegate to `parseBlock`.
- **Foreign keys detected by capitalized first character.** `author is User` -> FK. `author is text` -> field type.

---

## Clear Runtime (2026-04-02)

- **Type coercion is essential for `req.params` comparisons.** Express path params are always strings but db records store numeric ids. `matchesFilter()` must coerce.
- **Constraint enforcement order: required THEN unique.** A missing required field should give "field is required", not "undefined already exists".
- **`update()` needs two calling conventions.** `db.update('table', record)` by id, or `db.update('table', filter, data)`. Support both via argument count detection.
- **`update()` must preserve original numeric id.** When params pass string ids, restore the original numeric id after assignment.
- **Default secrets must warn loudly.** If CLEAR_AUTH_SECRET isn't set, `console.warn()` on startup.

---

## Clear Adapters Phases 25-28 (2026-04-02)

- **`define-as` path must return `{ node: assignNode(...) }`, not `{ name, expression }`.** The caller does `body.push(parsed.node)`.
- **Tokenizer strips `{` and `}` from text lines.** Use `lines[j].raw` for text blocks with interpolation.
- **`page` and `heading` are reserved keywords -- don't use as variable names.**
- **Parser `contentType` uses short names.** `'bold'` not `'bold_text'`. Match on actual values.

---

## Syntax v2 & Code Quality (2026-04-03)

- **Scope out before parser gymnastics.** If the compiler needs special-cases in 5 places, the syntax is wrong. Always ask "is there a simpler design?" before touching the parser.
- **E2E finds bugs that 792 unit tests miss.** Do E2E early, not after "all tests pass."
- **Security checks should be errors, not warnings.** DELETE without auth should block compilation.
- **The `as a new todo` pattern -- decorative syntax the compiler ignores.** Syntax that exists purely for readability, generating identical code.
- **CRUD nodes must use `{ isCrud: true, node }` return shape.**

---

## Interactive Patterns & Layout (2026-04-03)

- **Inline layout modifiers are the answer to WYSIWYG.** If changing it changes the SHAPE of the page, it goes inline. If it changes the LOOK, it goes in a style block.
- **Behavioral modifiers need special handling, not just CSS.** Tabs, modals, collapsible sections need both CSS AND JavaScript. Parser marks them with `__tabs`, `__modal` etc. in inlineModifiers.
- **`toggle` collides with `checkbox`.** Guard with `!(tokens[1].value === 'the' || tokens[1].value === 'this')`.
- **Auto-generated E2E tests from the AST are surprisingly powerful.** The AST already contains everything needed to test the app.

---

## Generated Code Quality (2026-04-03)

- **Middleware ordering: logging -> CORS -> auth.** CORS must come before auth so OPTIONS preflight requests don't get 401.
- **HTTP status codes must match the method.** POST -> 201, DELETE/PUT -> 200. Thread `endpointMethod` through context.
- **Full-stack apps need `express.static(__dirname)`.** Without it, style.css isn't served.
- **FK-aware E2E tests need unique values for `matches email` fields.** Emit `_uniqueEmail()` counter.
- **Keyword typo detection via Levenshtein distance.** Edit distance 2 catches `repat`, `defne`, `retrn`.

---

## Compiler Refactoring -- Session 7 (2026-04-03)

- **`compileBody(nodes, ctx, overrides)` replaces 25+ identical patterns.**
- **`parseConfigBlock(lines, startIdx, indent)` handles config blocks.**
- **Extract node compilers when the case block exceeds 30 lines.** Don't over-extract small cases.

---

## Theme & Preset System (2026-04-04)

- **Synonym collisions when repurposing keywords.** `theme` was a synonym for `style`. Always check `synonyms.js` before claiming a keyword for a new purpose.
- **App presets need different HTML wrapping than page presets.** App presets skip `max-w-5xl` wrappers because they participate in flex layout.
- **`parseExpression` returns `{ node, nextPos }` -- always use `nextPos`.** If you don't advance `pos`, subsequent token checks silently fail.
- **Block-form parsing for sub-expressions requires endPos.** Pass `endPos` to `parseExpression` to stop before boundary keywords like `returning`.
- **Layout detection must happen before body/main class decisions.** Variable ordering in `compileToHTML` matters: detection flags first, then dependent decisions.

---

## Parser / DSL Extension (2026-03-17)

- **New parser keywords go BEFORE continuation logic in parseBlock.** If you add a keyword check after the `isAssignmentLine()` check, any keyword that looks like an identifier gets swallowed by assignment parsing first. Specific patterns first, generic fallback last.
- **`processedEndpoints` dedup Set prevents double-compilation.** An endpoint inside a `page` block would get compiled once by the page walker and once by the top-level body loop. Track processed node references.
- **Validator `declared` is a stack of scopes, not a flat Set.** Functions and blocks push new scopes. Variables declared inside a function body shouldn't leak to the outer scope after the function ends.

---

## Playground & Design System (2026-04-05)

### DaisyUI v5 CDN
- **DaisyUI v5 CSS path changed from `/dist/full.min.css` to `/daisyui.css`.** The old path returns a 63-byte error. Always verify CDN paths when upgrading major versions.
- **ORB (Opaque Resource Blocking) blocks CDN CSS inside sandbox iframes.** Download DaisyUI CSS locally and inline it into iframe `srcdoc` via string replacement. The regex `/<link[^>]*daisyui[^>]*>/i` swaps the CDN link for an inline `<style>` block.
- **Tailwind v4 browser CDN is `@tailwindcss/browser@4`, not `cdn.tailwindcss.com`.** The old v3 CDN still works but causes screenshot timeouts in preview tools due to heavy processing.

### Browser Server
- **`receiving` variable not bound in browser server.** The Express compiler emits `const todo_data = req.body;` for endpoints with `sending todo_data`, but the browser server compiler didn't. Both paths need identical variable binding logic.
- **`process.env` doesn't exist in browser.** Auth-protected endpoints reference `process.env.CLEAR_AUTH_SECRET` which crashes. Fix: shim `window.process = { env: { CLEAR_AUTH_SECRET: "browser-dev-secret" } }` at top of browser server IIFE.
- **Browser server needs `iframe.onload` before sending requests.** The fetch interceptor isn't ready until the script executes. In the API tester, wait for iframe load before enabling Send buttons.

### Design System
- **GAN method is mandatory for UI work.** Never edit compiler HTML output directly. Design a static mock first, screenshot it, then edit the compiler until output matches. The mock is the discriminator, the compiler is the generator.
- **New themes require parser validation update.** Adding `arctic` and `moss` to CSS_BASE isn't enough — `parser.js:1073` has a `validThemes` array that must include them or the parser rejects the theme directive.
- **`BUILTIN_PRESET_CLASSES` drives all preset styling.** When updating the design system, this is the single object to change. Tests check exact class strings, so update tests in the same commit.
- **`rounded-box` is DaisyUI v5's semantic border-radius.** It reads `--radius-box` from the theme. Use it instead of hardcoded `rounded-xl` so radius adapts per theme.

### Playground
- **Compile animation: scan line + streaming code.** A CSS `@keyframes scan` line sweeps across the editor, then the JS output streams line-by-line into the code tab. Honest animation — shows real output, just revealed gradually.
- **Interactive API tester injects a hidden iframe with browser server.** Each endpoint card has a Send button that calls `iframe.contentWindow.fetch()`. POST endpoints get a pre-filled JSON textarea generated from table schema fields.

## Session: App Output Quality (Phase 29.1)

- **CSS Reset Kills Tailwind.** `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }` in CSS_BASE overrode every Tailwind utility class (p-8, mb-8, gap-6 all rendered as 0px). Fix: use `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }` only. This was the root cause of all compiled apps looking flat/cramped.
- **Context-Aware Rendering.** The compiler's `buildHTML()` needs to know what section preset it's inside (app_header, metric_card, card_bordered, etc.) to emit the right classes. Solution: `sectionStack` array pushed/popped during section traversal. Without this, every heading was a giant `<h1>`, every button was `btn-sm`, every text was body text.
- **Landing Page Presets Need Flex Centering.** `page_hero` and `page_cta` need `flex flex-col items-center gap-6` for centered layout with proper spacing. Without this, hero sections have no visual hierarchy. Links in hero sections should be `btn btn-primary btn-lg`, not `link link-primary`.
- **Single Theme CSS.** The compiler was emitting all 5 theme CSS blocks into every compiled app. Fix: split CSS_BASE into CSS_RESET + THEME_CSS map, pass theme name to _buildCSS(), emit only the active theme.
- **Empty Section Comments.** The JS compiler emitted `// Section: Nav` even when the section body produced no JS code. Fix: return null when bodyCode is empty.
- **Playground Should Not Auto-Compile.** Loading an example or typing should not trigger compilation. The user should explicitly click Compile. This makes the playground feel intentional, not reactive.
- **ASCII Diagrams Need Character Counting.** Box-drawing characters (┌─┐│└─┘) are single-width in monospace fonts. The `►` arrow character counts as 1 char in JS .length but visually takes 1 column -- same as any other char. The real alignment issue is always about counting characters in the label text between boxes (e.g., "POST /api/contacts" is 18 chars, "GET /api/contacts" is 17 chars). Always count characters, don't eyeball.
