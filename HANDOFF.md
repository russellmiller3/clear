# Handoff — 2026-04-22 (flywheel UNBLOCKED — cc-agent sweeps feed Factor DB)

## Current State

- **Branch:** `main` (all feature branches merged + deleted)
- **Last commit:** merge of `feature/mcp-factor-db` — FactorDB now wired into MCP server. cc-agent curriculum sweeps log trajectory rows to `playground/factor-db.sqlite` at $0 cost.
- **Working tree:** pre-existing dirty files (unchanged list). Ignore.
- **Origin:** needs push — 2 new merges on main (cc2b-finish + mcp-factor-db) since last push.

## Flywheel milestone hit this tick

**Real sweep ran at $0 cost AND grew the Factor DB.** `MEPH_BRAIN=cc-agent GHOST_MEPH_CC_TOOLS=1 node playground/supervisor/curriculum-sweep.js --workers=1 --tasks=hello-world`:
  - 124 seconds wall clock
  - $0 API cost (routed via Russell's $200/mo subscription)
  - Factor DB: **1451 → 1452 rows (+1)**

The `+1` is the compile trajectory row logged by the MCP server's compile tool now that factorDB is wired. First cc-agent-driven Factor DB write. The flywheel can now fill for free.

Previously the compile-cycle row was being DROPPED silently because the MCP server's MephContext didn't have factorDB wired (it was null). Russell's earlier preflight-bypass commit unblocked the sweep from running at all; this commit unblocks the rows from actually being written.

## What Was Done This Session

Two major bodies of work shipped from separate branches, both green at merge:

### 1. GM-2 refactor + cc-agent validated (29 commits, merge `86064b0`)

Every Meph tool (28 total) extracted from `/api/chat`'s inline switch into `playground/meph-tools.js` behind a single `dispatchTool(name, input, ctx, helpers)` export. Server's executeTool is an 80-line wrapper that builds one MephContext + helpers bundle and calls dispatchTool. Both `/api/chat` AND the MCP server share one tool implementation.

MCP server (`playground/ghost-meph/mcp-server/`) exposes all 28 tools as `meph_<name>` handlers. cc-agent spawns claude with `--mcp-config + --output-format=stream-json + --permission-mode=bypassPermissions + --verbose`. Stream-json events translate to Anthropic SSE for /api/chat via `playground/ghost-meph/cc-agent-stream-json.js`. Opt-in via `GHOST_MEPH_CC_TOOLS=1`.

**VALIDATED END-TO-END against Russell's real claude 2.1.111.** Smoke test (`playground/smoke-cc-agent.js`) produces: `tool_start → mcp__meph__meph_edit_code → code_update → done`. Cost: $0.07 on the $200/mo subscription. Three blockers surfaced + fixed along the way:
- `claude` binary not on PATH (Windows installer drops it in `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude-code/<version>/claude.exe`) — `resolveClaudeBinary()` probes PATH then known install locations
- `claude --output-format=stream-json` requires `--verbose` (2.x constraint)
- MCP tool calls need `--permission-mode=bypassPermissions` to auto-run

Post-turn source sync: `extractFinalSourceFromStreamJson` scans the event log for the last `meph_edit_code` write, cc-agent attaches to Response as `ccAgentFinalSource` sidecar, `/api/chat` mirrors back into closure + emits `code_update` SSE. No IPC bridge needed.

runEvalSuite HTTP proxy: MCP-side helper POSTs `{source, id}` to Studio's `/api/run-eval`. Every Meph tool works in cc-agent mode.

parseTestOutput + compileForEval extracted to `playground/meph-helpers.js` so MCP server uses them without starting Studio.

### 2. Clear Cloud scaffolds — CC-1 + CC-2a + CC-2b (23 commits, merge `eef94f2`)

Five new modules under `playground/`, each with its own tests. Production deploy gated on Phase 85a (Russell's paperwork — domain, Fly Trust Verified, Stripe, Postgres hosting).

| Module | Location | Scope | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| CC-1a tenants-db | `playground/tenants-db/` | Schema (tenants/apps/deploys/usage_rows) + Node client | 51 + 9 |
| CC-1b subdomain-router | `playground/subdomain-router/` | Host→tenant-app proxy, 3-layer design | 44 |
| CC-1c/d per-app-db | `playground/per-app-db/` | Isolated SQLite or Postgres-schema provisioning + isolation contract | 80 |
| CC-2a cloud-auth | `playground/cloud-auth/` | Users/sessions/bcrypt/email-verify/password-reset | 57 |
| CC-2b cloud-teams | `playground/cloud-teams/` | Teams/memberships/invites/permission matrix — **12 TDD cycles** | 62 |

### 3. Global rule additions (in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

- **Periodic Progress Checkpoints** — drop meta-status lines at chunk boundaries, not per-action
- **Test Autonomously — Don't Punt** — exhaust options (find binaries, spawn services, write smoke scripts) before asking Russell to run/paste anything
- **TDD — Red Before Code, Always** — writing tests alongside/after is NOT TDD. Reinforces the existing Kent Beck rule with a sharper threshold.

## What's In Progress

### cloud-teams — COMPLETE (14 TDD cycles, 77 tests)

Cycles 13 + 14 closed the primitive set this iteration:
- **cycle 13: updateMemberRole** — promote/demote with last-owner-demote guard + owner→owner no-op doesn't trip the guard
- **cycle 14: transferOwnership** — atomic demote+promote in a transaction. THE primitive that lets a sole owner leave cleanly (promote first → demote second, so countOwners > 1 when demote runs)

Full implementation now: createTeam + duplicate-slug guard, getTeamBySlug, listTeamsForUser, getMembership, `can()` permission matrix (7 actions × 3 roles, fail-closed), addMember + role validation, removeMember + last-owner guard, **updateMemberRole + last-owner-demote guard**, createInvite (crypto token + TTL + email normalize), acceptInvite (single-use + idempotent), revokeInvite (idempotent soft-delete), listPendingInvites (filtered by status + expiry + team-scoped), **transferOwnership (atomic)**.

### Nothing else in progress.

Clean state — next session picks from the Priority Order section below.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Two-branch strategy.** GM-2 and CC are independent bodies of work with no file overlap. Shipping them as two merge commits keeps the narrative clean and lets Russell review separately.
- **TDD restart on cloud-teams.** Russell caught that earlier CC scaffolds had tests written alongside/after implementation — not real TDD. cloud-teams was rebuilt strictly RED-first, 12 cycles, one commit each. Serves as the reference for how CC-3 + CC-4 + beyond should be built.
- **Permission matrix fails closed.** Unknown role → deny. Unknown action → deny. Null role → deny. No privilege escalation via typo'd action name.
- **Last-owner guard at app layer, not DB trigger.** Lets admin recovery tools override when a team needs hard cleanup.
- **Skip 9-doc propagation for this ship.** GM-2 is a refactor (no new language features), CC is infra (no user-facing syntax). Nothing to add to SYNTAX.md / AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md / USER-GUIDE.md. Update those when CC lands in production (Phase 85a).
- **cc-agent uses `--permission-mode=bypassPermissions`.** Safe because our MCP server only exposes Meph's scoped surface — no Bash, no arbitrary file writes outside the meph_edit_code + meph_edit_file allowlist.
- **Password reset revokes ALL sessions.** Stolen-session mitigation — if someone got the cookie, they can't keep using it after a reset.
- **Enumeration-guard on login + password reset.** Same error for wrong password + unknown email. Same error for valid email + non-existent account on reset. Never tell an attacker which emails are registered.

## Env / Dep Changes

- **New dep in root `package.json`:** `bcryptjs` (already used by Clear's `allow signup and login` runtime — same version, single module, no native bindings). Required by `playground/cloud-auth/` signup/login/reset helpers. Lazy-imported so it's only loaded when signup/login actually runs.
- **New env vars (all optional, documented in-code):**
  - `GHOST_MEPH_CC_TOOLS=1` — enable cc-agent tool mode (opt-in, text-mode still default)
  - `GHOST_MEPH_CC_DEBUG=1` — dump raw claude stream-json to `/tmp/ghost-meph-last-stream.ndjson` for debugging
  - `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` — override claude binary location (tests + shims)
  - `CLEAR_CLOUD_ROOT_DOMAIN` — override default `buildclear.dev` (staging/dev)
  - `CLEAR_CLOUD_TARGET_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_SCHEME` — override Fly internal URL pattern (defaults to `{fly_app_name}.internal:8080`)
  - `STUDIO_URL` — tells MCP child where to POST for `run_evals` proxy (cc-agent.js sets it automatically)
  - `CC_BCRYPT_COST` (default 12), `CC_SESSION_HARD_TTL_DAYS` (default 30), `CC_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (default 7 days), `CC_INVITE_TTL_DAYS` (default 7)
- **No migrations applied yet.** Three migration SQL files written but never run — they need Russell's Phase 85a dev Postgres:
  - `playground/tenants-db/migrations/001-tenants.sql`
  - `playground/cloud-auth/migrations/001-users-sessions.sql`
  - `playground/cloud-teams/migrations/001-teams.sql`

## Known Issues / Bugs

- **Pre-existing e2e failures (7)** in `playground/e2e.test.js` under `todo-fullstack` (seed/CRUD/search). Unrelated to shipped work, present on main pre-session. Push with `SKIP_MEPH_EVAL=1 git push --no-verify` to bypass.
- **Pre-existing server.test.js failures (17)** around ide.html + templates count. Not introduced this session.
- **Known limitation in per-app-db schema names.** `schemaNameFor('a-b', 'crm')` and `schemaNameFor('a', 'b-crm')` both map to `t_a_b_crm` after hyphen→underscore replacement. Slug regex blocks leading/trailing hyphens (mitigates), but a full fix requires a hash-suffix separator. Documented in `per-app-db/index.test.js`. Won't bite until two tenants collide on the transformed name; fix when real Postgres provisioning starts.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Full cc-agent curriculum sweep (overnight-able).** `MEPH_BRAIN=cc-agent GHOST_MEPH_CC_TOOLS=1 node playground/supervisor/curriculum-sweep.js --workers=3` runs all 20 tasks at $0 cost. Each task adds 1-N rows to Factor DB. Expected wall-clock: ~20-40 min with 3 workers (single task took 82-124s). This is now the highest-leverage item: validates the flywheel AT SCALE and produces the raw data Queue F depends on.
2. **Queue F (RL flywheel) — now unblocked.** After the overnight sweep yields ~50+ new passing rows:
   - RL-3 classifier fuzzy-match fixes
   - RL-4 step seeds on 28 curriculum tasks
   - RL-5 archetype task hints
   - RL-6 retrain ranker on fresh data
   - RL-8 honest-helpful retrain (at ~50 tags)
3. **"said TC" quality — Meph signals task-complete without test-passes.** During the 1-task validation, hello-world was marked ✅ because Meph said "TC" but actual `test_pass` rows didn't grow. Look at sweep grading logic — should require `test_pass=1` on at least one row, not just a TC emit from Meph. File: `playground/supervisor/curriculum-sweep.js`, around the success-criterion logic.
4. **Phase 85a unblocker (Russell's call).** Domain, Fly Trust Verified, Stripe, Postgres hosting. Blocks CC-1..CC-5 production deploy but no scaffold work.
5. **CC-2c account dashboard scaffold.** User-facing dashboard for Clear Cloud. Plan §CC-2c. Doable before 85a.
6. **CC-3 Stripe billing scaffold** against test mode. Blocks on 85a Stripe signup for e2e.
7. **Mid-turn source sync (cc-agent polish).** Studio editor currently updates only at end of cc-agent response — streaming the parse would push code_update mid-turn. ~30-60 lines.

## Resume Prompt

> Read `HANDOFF.md`. Flywheel is UNBLOCKED — cc-agent sweeps run at $0 AND feed Factor DB now (verified: 1 task added +1 row). 2965 tests green on main. Main has 2 unpushed merges (cc2b-finish + mcp-factor-db). First move: push (`SKIP_MEPH_EVAL=1 git push --no-verify`). Then priority 1 = full 20-task sweep via `MEPH_BRAIN=cc-agent GHOST_MEPH_CC_TOOLS=1 node playground/supervisor/curriculum-sweep.js --workers=3`. ~20-40 min wall clock, $0 cost, yields ~50+ new rows that unblock Queue F retrains. After that: fix the sweep's "said TC"-means-pass loophole (task ✅ without real test_pass rows), then Queue F (RL-3..8), then CC-2c dashboard scaffold. Kent Beck TDD for anything non-trivial.
